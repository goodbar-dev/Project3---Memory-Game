## Installation

No installation necessary, just run the site in a browser.

## Usage

Click on each card to flip it over.  Once two cards are flipped over, if they match, they will remain displayed;
otherwise, they will flip back over.  Continue until all cards have been matched.

Once you win, a message will be displayed letting you know how many moves it took and how many seconds it took to win.

At any time you can click the reset button to start over.
